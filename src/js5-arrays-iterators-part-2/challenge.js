/* JS5 builds on the previous challenges and adds the use of MORE Array iterators, Arrays, For Loops, Conditionals (If, else, switch)

 */

/* 
  All challenges in this repository are separated into four levels: Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert.
  The expectation is to complete all Foundation level challenges, with Intermediate and upwards pushing your knowledge

  share it with the group!

 * The word "encrypted" would be broken into:
 *
 * ["e", "r", "t"]
 * ["n", "y", "e"]
 * ["c", "p", "d"]
